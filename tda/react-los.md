# React LOS

This project was huge. A very big publicly traded supply chain financing company wanted to migrate their existing PHP based LOS solution to React. And they came to us to get the project done.

#### Loan Origination System

A loan origination system (“LOS”) is technology that helps financial institutions generate loan documentation in a way that complies with regulatory and internal requirements. Banks and credit unions usually install loan origination software on their local servers or access it through a cloud-based platform.

Lets call my client, Company X. The LOS made by Company X was being used by some of the biggest banks of India. So obviously there was ton of money involved.

#### The story

This job needed 2 devs atleast, so I pulled in my friend from college. He is a way better React developer than me. So I asked him to join me and take lead.

They had a Project Manager(PM), a PHP dev. Both of them had worked on the current version. They both were our PoCs. We interacted with them daily to get to know the project plan and clear our queries. There was also the current backend team building it all in Java. There was team lead(TL) who was helping us with APIs.&#x20;

_Its not even been a year and I have forgotten every single one of their names_

The first month went into project planning and understanding the whole system. The software in itself was too complicated, it had its own terminologies that needed to be understood first before writing any code. We also flew to Mumbai, sat down in their office for a couple of days to understand better. They had booked us flights and stay.

#### Coding begins

We started writing code, every day we built a ton of things. Cause the project was too damn heavy, and  the PM guy almost always had unrealistic expectations. I was initially very scared of him but once I got to know him personally. I was very comfortable around him and I started setting the expectations right.

We first had to build this super customisable multi step form. The API was giving us the JSON data for the form, then it also included controls like visibility and rules to handle the UI logic.

Later we had to build to dynamic routing, where the routing information was also sent by the backend. The tables we had in the dashboard, from the very columns till the cell formatting was coming from the backend.

#### Spending a full month in their office

The project velocity was too low compared to their expectation. So Company X insisted that one of us come there and physically be available at the office. They had also hired 3 React devs, 1 was good the rest 2 were ultra-new to software itself I think. So I was there acting as a team lead, gathering requirements everyday from PM. Instructing the team on who works on what, then talking to backend team for all support required. Me , TL and PM would also discuss features that we would pick up next to be built.

I spent 10-11 hours a day at their office, even Saturdays for 3 weeks straight.\
