# React LOS

This project was huge. A very big publicly traded supply chain financing company wanted to migrate their existing PHP based LOS solution to React. And they came to us to get the project done.

#### Loan Origination System

A loan origination system (“LOS”) is technology that helps financial institutions generate loan documentation in a way that complies with regulatory and internal requirements. Banks and credit unions usually install loan origination software on their local servers or access it through a cloud-based platform.

Lets call my client, Company X. The LOS made by Company X was being used by some of the biggest banks of India. So obviously there was ton of money involved.

#### The story

This job needed 2 devs atleast, so I pulled in my friend from college. He is a way better React developer than me. So I asked him to join me and take lead.

They had a Project Manager(PM), a PHP dev. Both of them had worked on the current version. They both were our PoCs. We interacted with them daily to get to know the project plan and clear our queries. There was also the current backend team building it all in Java. There was team lead(TL) who was helping us with APIs.&#x20;

_Its not even been a year and I have forgotten every single one of their names_

The first month went into project planning and understanding the whole system. The software in itself was too complicated, it had its own terminologies that needed to be understood first before writing any code. We also flew to Mumbai, sat down in their office for a couple of days to understand better. They had booked us flights and stay.

#### Coding begins

We started writing code, every day we built a ton of things. Cause the project was too damn heavy, and  the PM guy almost always had unrealistic expectations. I was initially very scared of him but once I got to know him personally. I was very comfortable around him and I started setting the expectations right.

We first had to build this super customisable multi step form. The API was giving us the JSON data for the form, then it also included controls like visibility and rules to handle the UI logic.

Later we had to build to dynamic routing, where the routing information was also sent by the backend. The tables we had in the dashboard, from the very columns till the cell formatting was coming from the backend.

#### Spending a full month in their office

The project velocity was too low compared to their expectation. So Company X insisted that one of us come there and physically be available at the office. They had also hired 3 React devs, 1 was good the rest 2 were ultra-new to software itself I think. So I was there acting as a team lead, gathering requirements everyday from PM. Instructing the team on who works on what, then talking to backend team for all support required. Me , TL and PM would also discuss features that we would pick up next to be built.

I spent 10-11 hours a day at their office, even Saturdays for 3 weeks straight.

I would say that I really enjoyed living in Mumbai. I grew fond of the city, everything and everybody are always moving. Unlike Bangalore, people are more serious and true hustlers. I lived in a small room of an apartment in 10th floor. The view was amazing. I would take the local train to the office, work till 9. Then come back home to watch one episode of Mr.Robot. My dinner was 3 eggs, 3 slices of bread and two fruit juices. I daily spent only 200Rs on food and travel. It was unbelievable. You can live really cheap in Mumbai. Its not because I wanted to live cheap, I literally had not money. CompanyX hadn't paid us in 2 months. While this could be a trivial thing for any other agency. But for our 6 people team, two months could drain us out. I had no savings, no other money apart from what I had in my bank. With no assurance on whether they will pay us or not, I went to office every day and wrote the best React code of my lifetime. Like I promised, I brought the project's velocity to the expectation. I knew I could do it. I got it done and came back home.

#### Conclusion

We did not work with them after February 2024. The company though makes a ton of money is one of the underpaying companies I've ever seen. I feel a lot of tech companies in Mumbai are like that, they tend to exploit the hustle in people. I was talking one of their Java backend engineers, he was making 4Lakhs a year. He had 3years of experience. When I told him, I started my career with 15LPA. He said, bro is that even possible for me? This broke my heart, a lot of us have developed learned helplessness w.r.t. to their earning potential. I feel like I should do something about it to break this mindset that is limiting people.\
