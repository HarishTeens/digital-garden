We started preparing for HackNITR 2.0 around the month of November, which was 4 months before the event. We did not have much plan in the initial stage, but as we progressed and cleared a few checkpoints, it was clear that we are right on track. The ride was filled with ups and downs, rejections and approvals from Sponsors and Guests gave me mixed feelings. In the end, I was really glad that the organizing team has given its best efforts to make HackNITR 2.0 a fruitful event. Even organizing a hackathon has its own problem statement, the goal of organizing HackNITR 2.0 was to give encourage students to build innovative solutions. From the response we got, I believe we delivered what we promised. By organizing HackNITR 2.0 I have definitely learned a lot, the experience wasn't that smooth. Made a few mistakes, but mistakes make us strong :D

We had

1. PR(Public Relations): Responsible for inviting and managing guests
2. Design: Responsible for designing all assets from brochures to posters
3. Tech: Building the landing page, setting up the Discord server
4. Sponsorship: Responsible to do outbound cold email to potential companies for sponsorship.

**Lows**

* The organisers and hackers would have gotten to know each other even better if it would have been an in-person hackathon
* We had SpeedNetworking and Mini Events to encourage hackers to interact and bring them together. And we had a pretty good response from the hackers, but it could be improved to encourage a larger crowd.

**Highs**

* We got 80+ submissions which is phenomenal compared to the current standards of online hackathons.
* Most of the hackers who participated are beginners. It felt really amazing that HackNITR 2.0 paved way to their hackathon journey
* Gaurav Sen turning up to HackNITR 2.0 is one of the finest moments of the event. Apart from students, the event was attended by some working professionals as well.
* We made sure that atleast two of us from the organising team was available at any given time during the hacking hours in order to address the issues faced by the hackers.
* Alongside we were really grateful to have some students who volunteered to mentor and judge.
