# Google Developer Student Clubs Lead

### The inception

I had also applied to become the Google DSC lead. The previous lead Abel Mathew, my close friend and a forever mentor. He for some reason believed in me and stood by my side most of the time. He literally used to babysit me initially as I was a complete introvert. I didn't know how to talk to people, how to get things done, the only thing I was innately good at was writing. I love to write and it has stuck with me throughout my life. But transitioning from the guy who used to stay on mute to confidently switch on video and make everyone talk is a big achievement for me. I found a playful way to channel my inner charisma, I cared deeply for my team, I felt the responsibility on my shoulders to uplift my team whenever they needed me. I got so good at it that they nicknamed me "CheerLeader"

P.S. I didnt make that up, it is true...

Unlike the GitHub community, the Google community had a bit more structure to it. While they didn't send a truckload of swags. They had plenty of opportunities to showcase our engineering skills.

### Google Cloud Program Facilitator

Google Cloud hosts 30DaysOfGCP to help students learn cloud concepts for free through their simulation labs. Every campus needs a facilitator to manage the students progress and submit the report to Google. The ones who completed the tracks were awarded with Hoodies and swags.

### Badges Framework

Since we were hosting virtual events regularly. To incentivise other students to participate, we built a Badges Portal where the user can reward custom event for every badge they attend. These were supposed to mock NFTs which were trending at that time.

### Inifinite livestream (Project Moonshot)

Inspired by some Youtube channels. We wanted to build infinite livestreams where the viewers can interact with the video by commenting on the chat. It also had our projects being showcased in a carousel. On the top we were tracking the live count of Slack Community Channel. All of this hosted on a Microsoft RDS machine with a virtual adapter. We were running a local React app and streaming it via OBS to youtube.

### Ask Us Anything

Every week we hosted a Ask Us Anything which answered all the questions community members had. We brought in new Domain experts every week to give participants a chance to interact with them.
