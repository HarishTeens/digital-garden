# GitHub Campus Expert

### The inception

I applied and got selected as the first GitHub Campus Expert of our college(NIT Rourkela). The application required me to submit essays on some of the shared struggles that exist in our local community. I wrote the answers to tackle this problem to the best of my ability and I got in!

This was my first ever community leadership role. I had never picked up something like before in my life. The GCE community was my favourite community as it had such vibrant people. Everybody who got selected had a lot of enthusiasm and were passionate to grow their communities. We were also lucky that it was 2020(COVID lockdown). Sitting at home, we had a lot of free time to connect and organise events virtually.

My Medium article below is a comprehensive guide of what the GCE program includes. If you're wondering what's the ultimate resource from the program. It is **People, People, People.**

### Autumn Hacks II Organiser

As soon as I joined, I voluntered to help LPU community to host their hackathon(Autumn Hacks). Thats where I met Vishal, Fenil, Nimit who are still close to me.&#x20;

They were kind enough to let me kick off the opening ceremony and host a work on Git & GitHub.

### Building the core team

I built a team from scratch with some passionate juniors. They were all freshers at that time and their contribution was monumental to the community's growth. I call them **"My Fav Team"**(the whatsapp group still exists). It consists of Abhibhaw, Astha, Pritish, Ritesh, Sriram. They were together with me for everything. By everything I mean, doing mundane social media posts, managing our Slack Channel, hosting online events, doing admin work.

They were all passionate software developers, they were purely here for the learning and a good heart to grow the community. I am very happy to share that they have achieved far more than I could ever image in their individual careers and community milestones. If anyone asks what is the most impact thing I have ever done. It would be this, simply putting them all together in the same Google Meet. Then we watched the magic happen.

### Hacktoberfest Online Meetup

After my experience of hosting virtual events for Autumn Hacks, I took that learning and hosted a mega event where we invited guests and covered multiple sessions in the same track. At this point, some OpenSource tools & companies were reaching out to us to showcase their product. Some of them were Aviyel, CRIO, leapcode.

### Twitch Moderator at GitHub Universe 2020

GitHub Universe 2020 streamed on Twitch. It was really cool to be backstage with all the GitHub Universe guests and moderate the chat. As a thank you gesture, GitHub Education shipped me the hoodie which I did not expect.

### Swags, Swags, Swags

I got kilos of swags from GitHub. It reached a point where I am fed up with swags altogether. I made sure all of these was shipped to our community members, participants and contest winners. And somehow there was still a box left the last I checked with my juniors. Here are some of the them\
