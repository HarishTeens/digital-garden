## The story of how it began

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It all started on March 2nd, 2021 through the above message on GitHub Education Slack. That's how we got together to plan something that was gonna have a huge impact on our lives. In the beginning, we didn't have a clear picture of how the show is gonna flow. After a few weeks of regressive planning, we finalized the title "Security Shorts" and the catchphrase "Weekly dosage of Security".

**Welcome to GEST**

Once we submitted the proposal about our plan for Security Shorts, we got on an interview call with Elise Moe. The call went real smooth, we had prepared all that we needed to get started and I believe we nailed it. A couple of days after, we wake up to a mail saying...\\

#### Buying hardware and setting up

With the excitement of getting accepted into the program. We were exploring hardware to buy for our dreamy Stream setup. Setting up for the first show required a lot of effort, as this is our first time streaming together, we needed time to figure out the flow for the show. But once we figured it all out for the first show, the upcoming shows just needed a few improvements here and there on top of the foundation we had already.

### Our Workflow

Huge thanks to Notion, from making notes for the show to managing guest invites. We had everything managed on our Notion workspace, wouldn't have been this smooth without this awesome Productivity tool.

#### Reaching out to guests

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is how our magic board looks like now, but when we started out it was completely empty üòÜ. Once we finalized our first guest "Harsh Bothra", we got heavily invested in it that we barely thought about our plans for the next one. Once the first episode was over, we felt immense pressure to plan out everything for the second episode in less than 7 days. This required us to take a different approach to reach out to guests.

So what we came up with is we would brainstorm for guests and we would send them invitations all at once. Batching the invites into 4 gave us a lot of breathing space as we would have the guest for the next confirmed once this is done.

Finalizing the guest for the week is the first step of our pipeline. Next was to create the issue as soon as possible.

#### Creating Issue

Even though we mailed the guests a few weeks beforehand, some tend to reply late or we had to reach out to them on a different platform like Twitter or Discord. So this took some significant time, and never let us multitask on issues. Although we tried our very best to create the issue with all the required information for the social media posts. The social media posts play an important role as it is the only means of letting people know about the weekly episode.

The issue needed two inputs, the captions, and the poster. A big thanks to our designer Vinit who designed spectacular posters for every episode. Once the poster is ready on Figma, we would review it and finalize it. Along with the captions for the Social media posts, the issue was all set for the week.

#### Show Prep

Preparing for the show is the major block in the pipeline. All the good things you must have seen were planned here in this step. Whatever you saw was only the tip of the iceberg as we come up with a lot of crazy ideas that didn't sound and appropriate for our show. Although the recommended time limit is an hour, we didn't feel like dropping some amazing content due to time constraints.

Now, here are the three steps that go into the show prep

* Research individually

Just like a hacker, we do recon first! Collect all the information we could about the guest/topic. Go through their works, previous interviews, or talks if any. These help a lot actually into knowing more about the guest.

* Merge and Set the flow

Once we have gathered sufficient information on the target, we now plan our attack. Nah, I'm just kidding, our mission is to bring peace ‚úåÔ∏è

We now put together all we got and set the flow of questions, as we did more shows we learnt that the placement of a question is very important. This was required for a smooth transition of conversations that made the whole show more lively and natural.

* Divide

Once we have all the things we gotta ask and say in the show, the last step is to divide the parts among us. It gets really tricky to have enthusiastic hosts on the stage, sometimes we tend to start speaking at the same time. To overcome this, we invented **THE GOLDEN RULE.** The rule says

> The host who asked the question gets to talk first right after the guest ends their reply. The other host shall not say anything until the former host completed what they gotta say.

Pretty slick right! This saved us from overlapping and it goes a long way!

#### Show setup

* Sending Streamyard invite to the guest
* Sharing the questions doc with the guest for feedback
* setting up streamyard with the backdrops
* joining the call 20 mins before the show
  * instructions
  * explain flow to guest
  * test everything

#### Go Live!

* 5min countdown timer
* rock the show
* end broadcast

#### Backstage chat and selfies

The most fun part of all :heart\_on\_fire:

* feedback from guest
* RGB on issue
* Thank you mail
* Tweet the selfie

#### Conclusion

For two 20year old kids, we were living one of the best times of our lives talking to these Security Celebs on Twitch Stream. I'm very grateful to GitHub Education for the opportunity, though I did not pursue a career in Security, I am very fascinated by the passionate people who work on it.
